# ORDER BY

The "ORDER BY" keyword simply sorts the rows of the table based on the column name provided. You can follow the `ORDER BY columnName` with "ASC" or "DESC" \(for ascending or descending\) to dictate the direction of the sort.

```sql
SELECT Major, StartingMedianSalary FROM Degrees ORDER BY StartingMedianSalary DESC
```
